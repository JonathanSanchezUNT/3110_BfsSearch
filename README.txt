Author: Jonathan Sanchez
EUID: js1612

In order to compile the project use: g++ *.cpp
Once compiled, execute the program with: ./a.out

This program will be reading in a file named "data2.txt" which is assumed to be in the current repository. Once the program is executed the output will be saved into a new file named "out2.txt", which will say if the graph is connected or not. 

This program will read in an adjacency list and create a "graph" that will be used to perform a BFS search and say if the "graph" is connected or not.
